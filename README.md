# AzueroZarrukEducation
This repository includes the code used for the paper about the effects of student loans on the demand and the provision for higher education. We use a 32 core machine to run the code. If you want to run the code in a machine with different configuration, it is necessary to modify the Makefile in the Equilibrium Computation folder.
